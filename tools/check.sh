# --- THE CONTENT GATE (P4-C1) ---------------------------------------------
# Two checks, both cheap (about 0.1 s together), both about the same thing: the
# committed headers under src/data/ are GENERATED, so nothing may hand-edit
# them and nothing may edit the JSON without re-running the generator.
#
#   1. tools/content/verify.py is the content pack's OWN gate. It travels with
#      the JSON and validates all 60 species against the design rules, importing
#      nothing from the generator - so a green run proves the deliverable
#      consistent even if gen_content.py is wrong.
#   2. gen_content.py --check regenerates every header in memory and diffs it
#      against the tree. It catches a hand edit to a generated header AND a JSON
#      edit that was never regenerated, which is the drift that would otherwise
#      only show up as a save recorded against a CONTENT_VERSION nothing built.
#
# Skipped with a WORD, not silently, if python3 is missing: a gate that decides
# not to run must say so. THE OUTER TEST IS A HARD FAIL, not a skip, and the
# difference matters: the other `if [ -f ... ]` guards in this file cover gates
# whose subject does not exist YET, while tools/content is a COMMITTED
# deliverable that src/data/*_table.h is generated from. Missing, it does not
# mean "not this phase", it means the gate's input was deleted - and until this
# `else` existed, `rm -rf tools/content` printed GATE OK and exited 0, which is
# the exact shape of failure this file's own comment forbids.
